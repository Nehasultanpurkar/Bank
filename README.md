NodeJS Library and book Management System

The project's primary motivation was driven by a desire to enhance skills and gain valuable experience
by venturing outside the comfort zone. Although my initial knowledge of React.js was limited, I took
on the challenge and embarked on a journey of expanding my skill set and exploring unfamiliar tech nologies. This project served as a platform for me to learn and acquire new skills, which I believe will
significantly benefit me in future endeavors. By pushing myself beyond what I was familiar with, I
have gained valuable insights and experiences that have broadened my horizons and allowed me to
grow both personally and professionally. I am confident that the skills and knowledge acquired
through this project will serve as a solid foundation for my future endeavors in the field.
The project is primarily divided into two parts. Acquiring the knowledge and concept of React Js
framework was the first goal of the project. Another part was to put the theory into practice and build a
simple website design Library Management System with React Js. With these sets of goals, the thesis
began with the theoretical subjects about React Js and its concepts. To understand the knowledge and
concept of React Js various research was done with the help of the technologies available on the Inter net. In the final part of the project, the goal was to build a website design. After some study of several
web services technologies, the development framework was executed. This system offers an organized
platform to the users. It overcomes the limitations of old library management and provides a platform
for teachers, students, and administrators with effective library management resonating with the mod ern generations. Even though the project Library Management System (LMS) still is an ongoing pro ject website design, it has met the requirements to complete the thesis and to provide all the require ments to accomplish the objectives of the thesis. In summary, the objectives of the thesis were ac quired when comparing the two parts of the thesis with the result. Additionally, opportunity to learn
the variety of web development matters, and experience was also gained while completing  the thesis.
